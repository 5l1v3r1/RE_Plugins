QuickCalls removed..


all addresses received by HandleMsg now use _atoi64

I should be able to compile this as a p64 now...and maybe as a 64bit version of the plugin for ida 7 64bit..
still no client updates yet...

clients with an underscore have not yet been worked on


regular calls changed:

there was an optimization where [:hwnd] was optional for many functions because SendMessage could handle the 32bit return
this can no longer be used if we need to support 64 bit return addresses and work from a 32bit process...

	q  14 funcstart:funcIndex[:hwnd] - hwnd no longer optional...
	q  15 funcend:funcIndex[:hwnd] - hwnd no longer optional...
	q  33 nextea:va[:hwnd]  - hwnd no longer optional...
	q  34 prevea:va[:hwnd]  - hwnd no longer optional...
